Extract testfiles and output with: 
$ tar -xvf testfiles.tar.gz
$ tar -xvf output.tar.gz

Assuming you've extracted these to the same parent directory, you can test your assignment on all of the tests in one go with:
$ cd testfiles
$ for file in *; do ../assign1 < $file > ../result; diff -iEBbw ../output/$file ../result; done

If 'diff' produces no output, then you pass the tests!
